    "The correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "A correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A positive value indicates a positive relationship, while a negative value indicates a negative relationship. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient represents the strength of the relationship, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a correlation coefficient of 0.7 suggests a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA. This means that as SAT scores increase, the college GPA tends to increase as well. The closer the correlation coefficient is to +1, the stronger the positive relationship between the variables. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and there may be other factors influencing the college GPA that are not captured in the SAT scores."

    "a. To find the percentage of individuals in the dataset with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we need to calculate the z-scores for these heights and use the standard normal distribution table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score formula is:\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "x is the height,\n",
    "μ is the mean height,\n",
    "σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 160 cm:\n",
    "z1 = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "For 180 cm:\n",
    "z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table, we can find the corresponding probabilities:\n",
    "P(-1 < Z < 1) = P(Z < 1) - P(Z < -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Look up the values in the Z-table:\n",
    "P(Z < 1) ≈ 0.8413\n",
    "P(Z < -1) ≈ 0.1587\n",
    "\n",
    "P(-1 < Z < 1) ≈ 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, approximately 68.26% of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. The average height of a sample of 100 individuals will also follow a normal distribution with the same mean but a standard deviation of σ/sqrt(n), where n is the sample size. In this case, n = 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score for an average height of 175 cm can be calculated as:\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / (σ / sqrt(n))\n",
    "= (175 - 170) / (10 / sqrt(100))\n",
    "= 5 / 1 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 5, which is very close to 0. According to the standard normal distribution table, the probability is approximately 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that the average height of a randomly selected sample of 100 individuals is greater than 175 cm is approximately 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. To calculate the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we can use the same formula as in part a:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "= (185 - 170) / 10\n",
    "= 15 / 10\n",
    "= 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. We know that 5% of the dataset has heights below a certain value. This corresponds to the z-score that encloses the lower 5% of the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that the z-score for a lower tail probability of 0.05 is approximately -1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the height corresponding to this z-score, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = μ + (z * σ)\n",
    "= 170 + (-1.645 * 10)\n",
    "≈ 170 - 16.45\n",
    "≈ 153.55\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the approximate height corresponding to the threshold where 5% of the dataset has heights below it is approximately 153.55 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. The coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage:\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (σ / μ) * 100\n",
    "= (10 / 170) * 100\n",
    "≈ 5.88%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the coefficient of variation for the dataset is approximately 5.88%.\n",

    "Given the following information:\n",
    "Mean height: 170 cm\n",
    "Standard deviation: 10 cm\n",
    "Skewness: Approximately zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset is approximately normally distributed and the skewness is approximately zero, we can assume that the mean, median, and mode are all very close to each other. In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the skewness is close to zero, it indicates that the dataset is symmetrically distributed. This means that the data points are evenly distributed around the mean, forming a symmetric bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the given dataset, a skewness of approximately zero suggests that the heights of the 1000 individuals are symmetrically distributed around the mean height of 170 cm. This means that there is an equal probability of finding individuals with heights above or below the mean, resulting in a symmetrical distribution.\n"
